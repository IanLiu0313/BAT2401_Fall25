## Assurance of Learning

Learning goals derived from the department’s mission statement drive the delivery of this course. The affirmation of learning will be ascertained, if applicable, through an evaluation rubric that meets the AACSB Assurance of Learning Standards.

## General Course Policies

- **CLASS PREPARATION**: Classes are designed to supplement the reading materials (textbooks, course slides, and required readings). Therefore, lectures will not necessarily address the text directly and may not cover all the details in the reading materials. Students must read assigned materials as part of the learning effort. Reading the assigned materials is a good way to cultivate your critical thinking ability and help better follow lectures. Bottom line: Read course slides and required readings.
- **PARTICIPATION**: Participation in classes is expected for all students, and a lack of participation will impact the grade (see evaluation). Students need to inform the instructor before the class about any anticipated excused absences. See the university attendance guidelines for the definition of excused absences.
- **LATE SUBMISSIONS**: DO NOT wait until the last minute to submit your assignments as it is always possible to encounter network or computer problems. You do have a grace period of TWO day for late submissions without any penalties, any late work after the grace period won’t be accepted. Please come to my office hour if you need help on lecture, assignments or computer programming.
- **WRITING**: Professional writing is expected for all assignments, tests, or presentations. You can utilize the writing center if you need assistance. Grammarly and any other similar tools are recommended.
- **COMMUNICATION**: Course communication will be done through Canvas and/or email. Be sure to check both regularly for announcements, updates, etc. You are responsible for any content provided. Students need to inform the instructor before the class about any anticipated excused absences. See the university attendance guidelines for the definition of excused absences. Leaving the lecture early without permission is automatically an unexcused absence.
- **EMAIL CONVENTIONS**: Please put the course name and code in the email subject. Any email without a formal and proper subject may be directed to spam or trash.
- **EXAM DATES**: Please plan your travel arrangements carefully to avoid conflicts with exam dates. If you have unavoidable commitments that necessitate taking exams on different dates, please inform me well in advance. Note that such accommodations will be considered on a case-by-case basis and are not guaranteed.

## Grade Distribution

Grades will be assigned using the following distribution:

- A (93.0 – 100), A- (90.0 – 92.9)
- B+ (87.0 – 89.9), B (83.0 – 86.9), B- (80.0 – 82.9)
- C+ (77.0 – 79.9), C (73.0 – 76.9), C- (70.0 – 72.9)
- D+ (67.0 – 69.9), D (60.0 – 66.9)

## Coursework Requirements

### Exams

There will be THREE exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you've learned in the course thus far. 1 page of letter-sized cheat sheet is allowed for exams. A calculator is allowed as well. 

### Homework, Quizzes, & Other Activities

There will be a few random quizzes, 9 homeworks, and other in-class activities in this course. In-class activities are designed to help you learn the material, and you are encouraged to complete them. Homework assignments are posted on Canvas and should be legible, complete, and self-contained. Homework assignments are to be turned in at 11:59 PM on their due dates. **You are allowed a grace period of two day for late submissions**, but any late submissions after that will not be accepted. If there are extreme circumstances which prevent you from completing the assignment on time, please email me before the due date. Please familiarize yourself with the Canvas system early in the semester. If you are not sure if an assignment has submitted correctly, you may email me with your attached homework as proof that it has been completed by the deadline.

### In-Class Participation and Attendance

The attendance portion of the grade is made up of several components:

- Being physically present in class.
- Not distracting others while in class. This extends to other students. If your behavior impedes the learning environment of other students, it will be reflected in your grade.
- Completion of assigned coursework, including in-class activities, notes submissions and in-class quizzs.

In-Class Participation is essential for students’ engagement and learning experience. Following University policy, students with 4 or more absences may be dropped from the course before the withdrawal deadline or get an F for the final grade according to the University policies listed under the Course of Study Bulletin or may see their final grade affected.

In specific, you will need to complete the following tasks to earn the credits for In-Class Participation/Attendance:
- Submit your notes via Canvas at the end of the day of each lecture. The format of the notes doesn't matter, the submission is counted as your attendance. If you can't make it to the class due to unaviodable reasons, please do NOT make any submisions. 
- The last 10-15 minutes of each lecture will be group-work time. And a team of 3 will be asked to give the entire class a quick presentation about how you solved the assigned problem and what results you have got. This presentation will be counted as Team Problem Solving credits.  

### Examinations

**THREE** examinations will be given to evaluate your knowledge of the topics covered in lectures, readings, assignments, as well as the ability to interpret results. Make-up exams will not be offered unless the absence is for a university sanctioned event (excuse notes must be received before semester examinations) or the instructors deem that the absence was permissible due to extreme extenuating circumstances.

### Homework

In these 9 homeworks, you will apply what you've learned during the lecture and team-work time to complete statistics and probability related tasks. Homeworks are offered via Canvas, 3 attemps are allowed for each homework, and the **average** of the 3 attempts will be recorded as the final grade for the homework. Please complete the entire homework once you have started an attempt, otherwise, the system may automatically record **ZERO** for an unfinished attemp, which could lower your final grade for the homework.

### Datacamp Practice

Due to the limited time we are having in class, we won't be able to cover Python Programming in class. However, since it's one of the most important and popular programming languadges, we will learning Python through DataCamp.com, which is an online learning platform. Click the link [Datacamp](https://datacamp.com/) to join the classroom Datacamp and complete all the assigned courses by the end of the semester. Each course only takes a couple of hours. Don't wait until the last day of the semester. I will be available to answer any questions regarding joining the classroom or programming! Happy programming. Python is easy and fun learn.


### Accomondations

Trinity University is committed to providing equal access and equal opportunity to students with disabilities. As a sign of that commitment, the office of Student Accessibility Services (SAS) is to assist students who seek accommodations. Information is available at: https://new.trinity.edu/campuslife/campus-services/student-accessibility-services. Please let me know if you need any assistance as early as possible.

Accommodated testing can be taken in the Accommodated Testing Center (ATC, 227 Halsell) between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. on the exam dates. You must utilize the testing center if you want any allotted extra time for your exams. Students are responsible for scheduling their exams with the ATC. Students must take exams at the ATC on or before the scheduled exam dates.

### Grades Booster

Yes, I plan to drop **TWO** lowest homework grades by the end of the semester. At least **TWO** extra credit opportunities will be offered throughout the semester. Stay tuned :)

## Academic Honesty and Policy on the Usage of Generative AI (IMPORTANT)

The values of honesty, scholarship and the pursuit of excellence are central to the mission of Trinity University. The Academic Honor Code is the system through which Trinity students uphold these values by assuming individual responsibility for integrity. An environment that encourages personal responsibility facilitates one of the highest aims of education, the free pursuit of knowledge. The Academic Honor Code and related matters can be found at: https://inside.trinity.edu/academics/academic-honor-code:

## Electronic Recordings of Classroom Instruction

Please be aware that all classroom instruction, including student participation in classroom activities, is subject to recording and dissemination on the University’s secure course management system (Canvas). The recordings will be made available only to students enrolled in the course to facilitate online learning and review. Students are expressly prohibited from capturing or copying classroom recordings by any means unless approved; violations will be subject to disciplinary action. Instructors who wish to use a recording outside of class must obtain the written consent of any students who are personally identifiable in the recording.

## Required Video Sharing/Online Proctoring

The instructor reserves the right to use a Respondus Monitor or a similar tool on your computer while taking exams. Detailed instructions for use and downloading of the proctoring tool will be provided in an email. This software allows for online proctoring by monitoring individuals on their computer webcam, as well as video analytics to identify potential cheating. Any recordings will be treated as an education record subject to FERPA protections.

## Sexual Misconduct, Required Reporting, and Title IX

As a Responsible Employee who is committed to creating an environment where every member of our community can thrive, I want to let you know that I am a Mandatory Reporter. What that means is that I am required to report any instances of sexual misconduct, including sexual harassment, non-consensual sexual intercourse, non-consensual sexual contact, sexual exploitation, intimate partner violence, stalking, and related retaliation that I am aware of to the Title IX Coordinator. So, if you share information with me about any incidents that implicate the Sexual Misconduct or Anti-Harassment Policies, I am required to report all information to the Title IX Coordinator to make sure you have information about support resources and complaint resolution options. My report does not initiate the complaint process, and you are in control over how you choose to engage with our Title IX Coordinator. If you or someone you know has experienced sexual misconduct, including sexual harassment, I encourage you to share this information directly with the Title IX Coordinator or one of the individuals who has been designated as a confidential resource on campus. The reporting form is available here.


## Policy on Syllabus Changes and Contractual Obligations

This syllabus and course outline are subject to change in the discretion of the instructor during the course of the semester. Changes may be necessary because of student’s specific interest, the general class progression and emerging topics of interest. If any changes are implemented, they will be announced in class and/or posted to Canvas.
